Extracting core library stuff for combat style games.

AbilityManager tag system that helps decide when abilities can start, eg
- HeavySwordSwing cannot start while Stab is running (OnlyOne)
- Jump cancels Dash, but cannot start while Stabbing
- while Dashing, new abilities are available

Status system

Combatant, Hitbox, Hurtbox
- Hitbox and Hurtbox priorities for shielded/weak zones, or tip-smash-like power hits
- System that accumulates hits for a frame, and decides how to merge/dispatch them at end of frame

Input buffering

Timeline and TimelineAbilities
- experiment with timeline system for arranging frame-perfect durations for triggers, sfx, vfx, animations
- time scaling of full or partial regions (e.g. slow windup but fast release, charging and holding, etc)
